  # we add a new column which is the concatenation/contraction of the source and target (paste),
  # but here is the trick: we sort the source and target alphabetically (str_sort).
  # (inspired by this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32329315/duplicate-combination-of-values-in-columns?rq=1)
  # VoilÃ , now we can identify the duplicates!

  ungroup() %>%
  # we remove all the rows with duplicates "source_target":
#  distinct(source_target, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% # keep_all to keep all columns
  # IT WORKS! woot woot!
  # we can now keep only what we need: source and target:
  select(source, target)
  # FIN.
  


# hard thing to do now: find a nice combination of technology (ggraph or other),
# layout, arguments of the layout function, and how to label nicely...
# possibly, thinking "theoretically" what the best layout would be, is a good idea? or too hard?
# Maybe we should remove all non-programming languages/technologies
# (e.g. Slack, Asana, Windows, GitHub, Trello, AI, Internet-of-Things, ML/AI, ...)
# they clutter the graph and are not really interesting?
