  # we add a new column which is the concatenation/contraction of the source and target (paste),
  # but here is the trick: we sort the source and target alphabetically (str_sort).
  # (inspired by this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32329315/duplicate-combination-of-values-in-columns?rq=1)
  # VoilÃ , now we can identify the duplicates!

  # IT WORKS! woot woot!

# ==> kk, fr, graphopt, dh, mds...

# ALREADY TESTED: 
#   - lgl is not good, too crowded.
#   - fr is very bad, large cluster in the middle
#   - graphopt is not so good, too crowded
#   - mds -> place on a "plane", a bit strange

# test layout dh:

ggnet # a bit better we see the structure better. 
# we could try to play with the arguments if we want to improve the layout,
# e.g. more distance between all nodes.
# see https://igraph.org/r/doc/layout_with_dh.html


# hard thing to do now: find a nice combination of technology (ggraph or other),
# layout, arguments of the layout function, and how to label nicely...
# possibly, thinking "theoretically" what the best layout would be, is a good idea? or too hard?
# Maybe we should remove all non-programming languages/technologies
# (e.g. Slack, Asana, Windows, GitHub, Trello, AI, Internet-of-Things, ML/AI, ...)
# they clutter the graph and are not really interesting?
