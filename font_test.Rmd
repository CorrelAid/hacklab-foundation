```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(showtext)
library(sysfonts)
## Needed for the location of Candara on my system
font_paths("C:/Windows/Fonts")

## Add two fonts, Avenir and Candara
#font_add("gotham", "Gotham-BookItalic.ttf")

font_add(family = "<Gotham>", regular = "C:/Users/sofia/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Fonts")

#font_add("gotham", 
#         regular = "Gotham-Black.ttf", 
#         bold = "Gotham-Bold.ttf")
## set chunk options to use showtext
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.showtext=TRUE, gotham = TRUE)

```

The chunk below will use avenir.

```{r echo=FALSE, gotham=TRUE}

x = mvtnorm::rmvnorm(1000, c(0,0), diag(2))
plot(x, 
  las = 1, ylab = "Dependent variable", 
  xlab = "Independent variable", 
  pch = 19, col = rgb(0,0,1,.1) )
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
