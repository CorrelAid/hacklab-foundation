# Overview

Hacklab Ghana Developer Census 2020 is the first and most comprehensive survey of people who code in Ghana. In 2020, the Hacklab Foundation fielded a survey covering everything from developersâ€™ favorite technologies to their job preferences. This marks the first of annual surveys to be published. This maiden edition witnessed the participation of 266 developers who took the 20-minute survey earlier between November - December 2020.   

Despite our surveyâ€™s reach and capacity for informing valuable conclusions, we acknowledge that our results donâ€™t represent everyone in the Ghana developer community evenly. We have further work to do to make the Hacklab Ghana Developer Census 2020 a more inclusive, diverse platform, and a reflection in the community at large.   

We are committed to building on steps we have taken and improving the coverage, insights and beyond in the coming years to better improve the support and interventions needed to give developers a more enabling ecosystem to thrive. Some of these survey results directly guide those efforts. To address the characteristics of our data, be sure to check out where we summarize results by developer persona (Professional, Student, Hobbyists) or gender, highlight results for underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, or use survey weighting to correct for demographic skew.   

We looked at breakdowns by demographics throughout our analysis and its reflection of the distribution of talents.    

Want to dive into the results yourself? The anonymized results of the survey are [available for download]() under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/). We look forward to seeing what you find!  

This maiden edition could not have been successful without the contributions of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) and [CorrelAid](https://correlaid.org/).  


## Key Insights

Here are a few of the top takeaways from this yearâ€™s results.  [_add links and a few sentences_]

1.	Gender Representation
2.	Geographical concentration
3.	Most known Languages
4.	Most familiar Frameworks
5.	Communities
6.	Highest level of education
7.	Primary field of study (Business comes 3rd after Computer Engineering/Science and IT )
8.	Overtime & Compensation

# Developer Profile

## Type of Developer

### What describes you best?

The two biggest subgroups among the respondents are professional developers as well as students. Additionally, there are respondents coding as a part of their work, coding as a hobby, as well as former developers. 

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = '100%', fig.height = b6}

basic_barplot(my_df = compute_perc(Qs, profession_1), 
              a_factor = profession_1, its_values = perc, labels = perc_label, 
              title = "")
```

### Do you code as a hobby? 

Most of the respondents code as a hobby. Interestingly, professional developers seem to code for a hobby less often than students which may be related to their reduced time availability.

## Employment

```{r}

employment_data <- Qs %>%
  filter(employment_3 != "I prefer not to say") %>%
  mutate(
    employment_3 = factor(employment_3, 
                          levels(employment_3)[c(4,2,3,6,5,1)])
  )
```

Most of the respondents full-time employees. There is also a great share of students. Sadly, there is also a significant share of unemployed developers looking for work. 

When it comes to gender differences, there is a greater share of students among the female respondents. In addition, women seem to be self-employed less often when compared with men.

## Geography 

### Region

Most respondents come from the greater Accra region. However, the extent of concentration in Accra seems to be larger for professional developers than for students.

## Demographics


### Age

Most respondents are between 20 and 30 years old. 

While the students are very young in most cases, the professional developers display a little more variance in their ages. However, we have a very young sample at hand.

### Gender 

#### What Gender do you identify with?

There is a  greater share of women among the students than among the professional developers. 

Ghana's developer community may become more representative in the upcoming years.

### Do you have any dependents you care for? 

Among our respondents, women seem to have dependents they care for less often than men do. This may partly be due to the fact, that more women are still in their studies and that the women in our sample may be younger than the men.

# Technology and Tech Culture 

## Most Popular Technologies

These are the technologies with which the respondents have done extensive development work in over the past year.  


### Programming, scripting and markup languages

_HTML/CSS_ is the most used language, followed by _JavaScript_, _Python_ and _SQL_. Professional developers are more likely to use _JavaScript_ and _SQL_. _C++_ and _C_ are still widely used to teach coding to students.    


```{r}

  "C",			
  "C#",

## Wanted Technologies 

These are the technologies that the respondents are currently not using but want to work in over the next year.  

### Programming, scripting and markup languages

_TypeScript_, followed by _Python_ and _Swift_ are the technologies that professional developers do not use but want to learn. Students are interested in "the classics": _Python_, _SQ_, and _JavaScript_.

Respondents want to learn working with cloud platforms, in particular _AWS_ for the professional developers and _Microsoft Azure_ for the students.

## Work

### Job satisfaction

A little bit than more of 50% of the respondents are slightly satisfied or satisfied with their current jobs.
Whereas 20% are slightly dissatisfied or dissatisfied.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = '100%', fig.height=2}

barplot_ordered(my_df = compute_perc(Qs, job_satisfaction_22 ), 
                a_factor = job_satisfaction_22 , its_values = perc, labels = perc_label, 
                title = "Q22. How satisfied are you with your current job?")


```

#### Relationship between job satisfaction and overtime work

Interestingly, people who work more than 3 times a week overtime are satisfied with their job. There seems no relationship that the more overtime the less job satisfaction. The tendency is rather the opposite.

### Approximately how many people are employed by the company or organization you currently work for?

Half of the respondents work in a small company with less than 10 workers. Only 10% of the respondents work in a big company with more than 100 workers.

### Which of the following best describes your current job-seeking status?

60% of the respondents are open for new job opportunities and one in three respondents is even actively looking for a job.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = '100%', fig.height=b3}

basic_barplot(my_df = compute_perc(Qs, job_status_29 ), 
              a_factor = job_status_29 , its_values = perc, labels = perc_label, 
              title = "")

```

### In general, what drives you to look for a new job?

The main reason for developers is more income whereas for students it is gaining more experience and skills improvement.

## Developer Communities

2 in 3 respondents are members of a developer community.

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = '100%', fig.height=1}

basic_barplot(my_df = compute_perc(Qs, dev_community_member_32 ), 
              a_factor = dev_community_member_32 , its_values = perc, labels = perc_label, 
              title = "Are you a member of any other online/offline developer communities?")

```


The three largest communities to which respondents indicated membership were DevCongress (13.6%), Facebook Developer Circle (9.6%), and the Hacklab Foundation (7.4%).  

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width = '100%', fig.height=5.5}
# Warning! Check that all communities are in the plot. Depends on size (height) of figure and scale. Wordcloud excludes if names are too large (typically Facebook Developer Circle or DevCongress)
# I tried to pick a scale where the smallest were still legible.

# note: respondents can be members of several communities,
# we just count them all.
